# Thanks, I fixed your Inventory
 Customize several aspects of the player inventory. Slot x/y positions, highlight color, player render, etc.

 In Minecraft, the offhand inventory slot, the crafting input slots, and the crafting result slot don't line up with the rest of the grid. (literally unplayable)
 
 This mod allows you to customize the positions of these slots, as well as the position of the small player render. It also allows you to customize the slot highlight color of all inventories.

 Here is the config screen (more to come later!)
